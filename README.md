# AngularFitnessPrototype

Prototype of an fitness tracker, built with Angular, Angular Material (for UI components), AngularFire (Firebase/Firestore) and NgRX for state management

Future plans (which will be in a different repo/project):
1. Add more exercises to track.
2. Use my own design instead of Material Design.
